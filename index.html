			<h1>Communication</h1>
			<p>Imagine how vastly different your life would be today without a smartphone. In even the lightest use case scenarios, we don't usually go an hour without at least checking them. For better or worse, social media (and the messenging services tied to it) plays the main role in how most people communicate today, which is such a radical shift from the past. From having no online communication at all, to e-mail and SMS, and now entire websites dedicated to making contact with as many people as possible.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Even without considering the Internet, the mobile telephone is hardly a revolution of the past; alongside the modern smartphone, it is still very much a recent invention. Computer science, of course, has played the biggest role in helping the mobile phone become what it has become today.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Examples of computer science's presence in communication:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>IRC</li>
				<li>MSN Messenger</li>
				<li>Forums</li>
				<li>Social networks</li>
				<li>SMS</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Education</h1>
			<p>The vast majority of the ways in which we teach and learn have been touched by the hands of computer science. Think about the classrooms that have ditched old chalkboards and whiteboards for a more modern approach, one that is centered around technology and forward-thinking. The Internet allows us to answer all of our questions and more, in just milliseconds from us requesting the information. We live in an era that breaks records every day; never before in history has information been available this freely.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>E-learning classes are allowing more and more people to have access to a higher level of education than would ever be available to them, which is all thanks to the developments in computer science. We have new tools at our disposal, which enable us to learn in ways that weren't possible even just ten years ago. Sharing information with our peers has never been easier - with the introduction of 'cloud' storage spaces, we can upload all kinds of information freely whenever we like, and allow others to access it whenever they like.</p>

			<h1>Medical Imaging</h1>
			<p>Often to diagnose a patient or to get a better idea of what is going on in someone’s body to operate, doctors will get the patient scanned. The patient will be sent for different types of scans depending on what is wrong with them. Each type of scan yields a different sort of image of the patient’s body for example an X-ray only shows the bones and exposes the patient a limited amount of radiation, where as a CT scan will produce a 3D image of their insides mapping their internal organs and exposing them to the equivalent of 5 years of background radiation. Obviously, you wouldn’t be sent for a CT when you have a broken bone.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A simple X-ray only requires a method to create the X-rays, a photosensitive sheet, and the patient. The X-rays travel through the body and get attenuated by the material inside. Muscle and blood vessels aren’t very dense, so they don’t attenuate the X-rays much but the bones attenuate the X-rays a lot, so they don’t travel through the rest of the body. The image produced on the photosensitive sheet is black where the X-rays travelled through and the bones in the body cast a white shadow on the sheet. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A CT scan uses the same X-ray producing method but can create a much more detailed model of the patient’s body. This is possible due the X-ray source being rotated around the body and many data points being collected and using a computer to crunch that data to produce the model. The Ct scanner has the X-ray source and a collection of gamma cameras opposite each other. The gamma cameras can detect the X-rays and turn them into electronic pulses for the computer to use as data points. The assembly of the cameras and X-ray source are rotated around the patient 360 degrees. The different materials in your body attenuate the X-rays by different amounts and by collecting data from all angles the computer can try to find a model of the body that will cause the attenuation observed. This is no easy feat though, as there are many combinations of materials that attenuate the X-ray one after the other.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>These sorts of calculations would not be possible within a reasonable time without the use of computers. The models produced can be used by doctors to arrange treatment as they will know exactly where cancer is in the body so they can directly focus radiation on it without causing much damage to healthy tissues.</p>

			<h1>Breaking Enigma</h1>
			<p>The Enigma cipher was a polyalphabetic cipher, meaning the same letter isn't always enciphered as the same letter, which was used by the Germans before and during World War II. You could encipher and decipher a message using an Enigma machine with the key to encipher and decipher being the order of the rotors, starting positions of the rotors, and the connection of the plugs on the plugboard.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>At the end of World War I, the Polish were bordering two hostile nations: Russia and Germany, so they needed to know what they were up to. The Germans used the Enigma cipher to encrypt their messages. The Polish Cipher Bureau were able to determine the rotor settings of the Enigma machine for a set of messages using a time consuming mathematical method that had to be carried out for each of the possible rotor positions, since there were three rotors you could position them in six different ways. The Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski invented an electro-mechanical device that was called the bomba which would do all the heavy lifting; six were constructed, one for each rotor position permutation. Come 1938, the world is on the brink of war and Germany decides to up the security of the Enigma machine and add two new rotors that can be placed in the three rotor slots so there are now 60 permutations of the rotors. The Polish Cipher Bureau can’t commission another 54 bomba and in 1939 Poland was invaded by Germany, luckily, they passed their knowledge and methods to the allied forces.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In 1939 the British bombe was designed by Alan Turing which was installed in 1940. This new electro-mechanical device could be used to find the rotor order and starting positions thus providing the British with the daily key which could be used to decipher the Germans’ communications. The British being able to decipher the Germans’ messages prematurely ended the war saving millions of lives, so the bombe in effect ended the war and was the birth of modern computing.</p>
